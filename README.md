# 📝 Express Posts API

This project is a simple **Express.js REST API** for creating and fetching posts.  
It demonstrates how to use **list rendering logic** with validation, in-memory storage, and persistence using Node.js **fs** (File System) module.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Create a new post with:
  - `content` (1–280 characters)
  - `author` (required)
  - `tags` (up to 5 tags allowed)
- Retrieve all posts (sorted by newest first)
- Posts are saved to a **JSON file** (`posts.json`) so they persist after server restarts
- In-memory store + file persistence
- Basic error handling with proper status codes
